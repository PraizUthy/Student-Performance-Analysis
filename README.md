# Student Performance Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of a student performance dataset. The primary aim of this project is to identify variables that impact student performance.
## Project Description
The project is an in-depth analysis of student performance, carried out in a Jupyter notebook. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.
Through this analysis, the project seeks to understand what factors play a significant role in student academic performance. This kind of understanding can aid educational institutions in implementing strategic actions to improve learning outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It includes various student attributes and their corresponding academic performance.
## Methodology
The project was accomplished using the Python programming language within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The analysis mainly used pandas, numpy, and matplotlib/seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
## Results
From the exploratory analysis, several factors were found to significantly affect student performance. However, I observed that the categorical variables gender and test preparation courses have a higher correlation with the resulting scores of the students. Also, the female gender tends to do better than their male counterpart in reading, while males have higher grade points in math than females.
## Future Work
While the analysis has provided valuable insights, there's always room for further exploration and improvement. Future work could involve carrying out predictions on the performance of students using Machine learning algorithms on features that stand out the most.
